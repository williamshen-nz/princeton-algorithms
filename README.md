# Algorithms (Part 1) by Princeton

This repo contains my implementations of the assignments for
part 1 of the introduction to algorithms course.

## Assignment Scores & Notes
1. **Percolation** - 100/100, solves the backwash problem using two Weighted Quick Union Union Find objects.
2. **Deques and Randomized Queues** - 100/100, we build our own naive implementations of ArrayList and LinkedList.

## Project Structure
**.idea** - IntelliJ config files, run configurations should be set up and ready to go  
**src** - source files with each assignment in its own package  
**resources** - resources files for each assignment
